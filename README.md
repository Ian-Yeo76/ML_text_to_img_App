# ML_text_to_img_App
This script creates a GUI-based AI image generator using Tkinter and Stable Diffusion v1-4, designed to run on CPU only. Users enter a prompt, click "Generate", and the model generates and displays an image. It loads the model with an authentication token, processes input via torch and diffusers, and runs interactively for multiple generations.
